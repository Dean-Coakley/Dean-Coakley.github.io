        <p class="faq"><strong id="goals">What are the goals of the league?</strong><br>
        The two goals of the league are to give teams the chance for more competitive matches locally and to provide an opportunity for spectators to see one off games.
        </p>

        <p class="faq"><strong id="costs">How much is it going to cost teams to play?</strong><br>
        Teams have been asked for an entrance fee which will be used to cover administration and expenses. Teams will also be responsible for their own travel and facility hire costs. At the conclusion of the league, any funds remaining from the team entrance fees, and ticket sales to spectators, will be returned to teams to offset expenses with the goal of all teams having equal total expenditure.
        </p>

        <p class="faq"><strong id="womens">What are the goals of the league?</strong><br>
          <strong>Short answer</strong> is we don't think there are enough teams to make a women's league of the same format viable at the moment. If we are wrong in this please let us know as we would be delighted to work with you to make a women's league happen.
        
          <p>
            <strong>Longer answer</strong> is that we started off asking if we should do a mixed league or open and women's leagues. That conversation was around the time of All Ireland Indoors where the women's division was populated by four different clubs. While we fully understand that participation in one competition does not dictate participation in another, we felt that the number of additional clubs and teams needed to make either mixed or women's leagues viable would be too great.
